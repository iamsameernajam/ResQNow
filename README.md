## üìñ About The Project

In many regions, including here in India, emergency medical response times can be unpredictable. The process of finding, calling, and dispatching a nearby ambulance is often manual, chaotic, and stressful. This delay can have life-threatening consequences.

**ResqNow** was built to solve this problem. It is a real-time, map-based platform that:
* **Connects** users directly with the nearest available ambulance services.
* **Streamlines** the booking process into a few simple clicks.
* **Provides** live tracking and transparent communication, reducing anxiety for patients and their families.

Our mission is to leverage technology to save lives by making emergency medical transport accessible, reliable, and efficient for everyone.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:
* Node.js (v18.x or later)
* npm (v9.x or later) or yarn
* Git
* A MongoDB account (you can get a free cluster from [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

### Local Installation Guide

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/resqnow.git](https://github.com/your-username/resqnow.git)
    cd resqnow
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend Server:**
    ```sh
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following variables:
    ```env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    PORT=10000
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend Client:**
    ```sh
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add the backend API URL:
    ```env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:10000
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    * To start the backend server, run this from the `/server` directory:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```
    * To start the frontend client, run this from the `/client` directory in a separate terminal:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

The application should now be running locally at `http://localhost:5173`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (User Flow)

1.  **Sign Up / Login:** A user creates an account or logs in.
2.  **Enter Details:** The user enters their current location (or allows GPS access) and their destination (e.g., a hospital).
3.  **Select Ambulance:** They choose the type of ambulance needed (BLS, ALS, etc.).
4.  **Confirm Booking:** The system calculates an estimated fare and time. The user confirms the booking.
5.  **Driver Allocation:** A request is sent to all nearby, available drivers.
6.  **Driver Acceptance:** The first driver to accept is assigned the ride.
7.  **Live Tracking:** The user receives a confirmation and can now track the ambulance's location in real-time on the map.
8.  **Ride Completion:** The driver updates the status upon reaching the patient and then the hospital. The trip is logged in the user's and driver's history.

## üåê API Endpoints

The backend exposes a RESTful API for all operations. Here are some of the key endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                    | Description                                |
| :----- | :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/register`        | Register a new user.                       |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login`           | Log in a user and receive a JWT.           |
| `POST` | `/api/bookings`             | Create a new ambulance booking.            |
| `GET`  | `/api/bookings/user/:userId`  | Get all bookings for a specific user.      |
| `GET`  | `/api/drivers/available`    | Get a list of all available drivers.       |
